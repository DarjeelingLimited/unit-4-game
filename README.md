What this project does

This project randomizes a number and challenges the user to match the randomly generated number thru a series of clicks that add to the number.

Why the project is useful

This project demonstrates the use of javascript and using 'if/else if' statements, while ensuring a new randomly generated number is populated for each round of play.

How users can get started with the project

Users can interact with this game by clicking the crystal images, and they will attempt to match the randomly generated total number.  
The user can click on up to 4 crystal images which all have different values, and the user must match the randomly generated number without going over.
If the user goes over, they lose. 
If the user's crystal values add up to the randomly generated number, the user wins.
